#STUDENT RECORD MANAGEMENT

A simple yet functional Python-based Student Record Management System designed to show how a simple pytho program can handle real-world school record system. This program allows parents to view their child’s attendance
and teacher suggestions, while teachers can view student lists, count repeated names, manage student details, and add feedback directly into text files.This project demonstrates the use of Python’s fundamental concepts such
as lists, dictionaries, tuples, conditional logic, file handling, and user input.

The system provides two user modes :

1. Parent Mode

Authenticate using their child's ERP number

View detailed monthly attendance history

Read teacher suggestions stored in files

2. Teacher Mode

View the complete student list

Access ERP-to-student mapping

Count how many students share the same name

Add new suggestions to student files with automatic file updates

View updated suggestion records

The goal of this project is to offer a beginner-friendly implementation of school management features while practicing clean logic and Python file operations.
